# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

## Layout
There is a folder for each day's problem, and they are intended to be standalone as much as
possible. The solution files have a `main()` method at the bottom which delegates to some helpers.

## Environment
Solutions are written in Python 3. Some contain language features added in Python 3.8 üòç so may not
run on earlier Python versions.

Non-trivial solutions have associated tests that can be run with `pytest`.
